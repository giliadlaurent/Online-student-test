# Elearning

This is an Online-student-test written in php with the laravel framework. I started this project as a learning experience and to test out new things.

## Documentation

Currently there is no documentation for this project (But I'm slowly working on it). If there is interest in the project I'll pick up the speed for the documentation.

Though if you want to play around with it you just need to clone the repo, get composer and run the composer install and you're good to go.

I'm developing this project in PHP 7 (should work with 5.6) and using MariaDB for the database, but it should work with most databases.

The laravel version is 5.3.
